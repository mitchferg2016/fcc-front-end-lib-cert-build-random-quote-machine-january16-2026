# Random Quote Machine – Front End Libraries

**Completed:** January 16, 2026  
**Platform:** freeCodeCamp  
**Project Type:** Front End Development Libraries (React)

## Project Overview
This project is a Random Quote Machine built as part of the freeCodeCamp **Front End Development Libraries** certification.

The goal was to build a small interactive application that displays a random quote and its author, allows the user to generate a new quote, and provides a way to share the quote on Twitter.

The project introduces basic React concepts such as components, state, and event handling, while still using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a build system.

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Using React to build a small interactive user interface
- Managing application state to store and update quotes
- Rendering dynamic content to the DOM
- Handling user interactions (button clicks)
- Integrating an external sharing link (Twitter intent)
- Structuring a front-end project in a clear, readable way
- Passing automated UI tests provided by freeCodeCamp

## JavaScript / React Concepts Learned
- Creating a React component to represent the app
- Using state to store the current quote and author
- Updating state in response to user actions
- Re-rendering UI automatically when state changes
- Using `ReactDOM.render()` to mount the app to the page
- Separating concerns between HTML structure, styling, and behavior

## Key Concepts Explained (For Future Reference)
- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces using components and state
- **State:** Data managed by a component that can change over time and trigger UI updates
- **DOM:** The browser’s representation of the page that React updates efficiently
- **Event handling:** Running code when a user interacts with the page (e.g., clicking a button)
- **CDN-based setup:** Loading libraries like React directly from a URL instead of using a build tool

## Files Included
- `index.html` — Base HTML structure and script loading
- `styles.css` — Styling for layout, centering, and visual appearance
- `script.js` — React logic for rendering quotes and handling interactions

## Notes
This project was completed to practice building interactive front-end applications using React in a simple, beginner-friendly setup.

It reinforces core concepts such as state management, DOM rendering, and user interaction handling, which form the foundation for more advanced React applications and modern front-end workflows.
